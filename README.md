### PolygonPay Installation

**Please go to our [documentation](https://docs.polygonpay.com) for more detailed installation and usage instructions**

1) The first step is to sign up for a [PolygonPay](https://app.polygonpay.com/signup) account and obtain an API key.

2) The second step is to include the following two `<script>` tags and the one `<link>` tag in your HTML `<head>`. In order to optimize performance you should implement the minified versions of jQuery and polygonpayJS just like the ones below.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Seantheprogrammer93/polygonpayjs@v2.0.0-alpha/polygonpay.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Seantheprogrammer93/polygonpayjs@v2.0.0-alpha/polygonpayjs-style.min.css">
```

3) The last step is to include the following `<div>` tag in the `<body>` of your HTML document.
```html
<div class="polygonpayjs"></div>
```

After you complete steps 1, 2 and 3 your HTML document should look like the example code below. Please, feel free to copy the code below if you want a simple starting point for your HTML document.
```html
