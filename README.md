### PolygonPay Installation

**Please go to our [documentation](https://docs.polygonpay.com) for more detailed installation and usage instructions**

1) The first step is to sign up for a [PolygonPay](https://app.polygonpay.com/signup) account and obtain an API key.

2) The second step is to include the following `<script>` tags in your HTML `<head>`. In order to optimize performance you should implement the minified versions of jQuery and polygonpayJS just like the ones below.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Seantheprogrammer93/polygonpayjs@v2.0.0-alpha/polygonpay.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Seantheprogrammer93/polygonpayjs@v2.0.0-alpha/style.css">
```

3) The last step is to include the following `<div>` tag in the `<body>` of your HTML document.
```html
<div id="polygonpay" class="polygonpayjs" data-api-key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"></div>
```
*Note: Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your PolygonPay API key, it can be found [here](https://docs.polygonpay.com/dashboard). Also, we strongly recommend using the hidden attributte in your `<div>` for security purposes.*

After you complete steps 1, 2 and 3 your HTML document should look like the example code below. Please, feel free to copy the code below if you want a simple starting point for your HTML document.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Seantheprogrammer93/polygonpayjs@v1.0.2-alpha/style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div id="polygonpay" class="polygonpayjs" data-api-key="1"></div>

    <button class="polygonpay-add-item" data-title="Hat" data-description="This is a hat" data-price="15.79"
        data-url="https://example.com/hat" data-imageSrc="https://example.com/hat.png">
